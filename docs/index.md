Official Collections: [DEVILISH](https://opensea.io/collection/devilish-nfts) | [CURSED OBJXTS](https://opensea.io/collection/cursed-objxts)

#### 😈 DEVILISH

A collection of all creatures devilish, angelic, and unknown.

#### 🔪 CURSED OBJXTS

Trinkets offered to holders of grateful devils.

## Smart Contract Migration

DEVILISH was first minted in July 2021 on the [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) chain, where the collection lived briefly before moving to [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/nft/). Both versions were created and hosted on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/).

At the beginning of 2023, the collection was migrated off Opensea's storefront and onto it's own contract. (Code provided by [Manifold](https://www.manifold.xyz/))

#### Why migrate?

When you create an NFT collection on Opensea, you are using their _shared storefront_. This means that you do not truly own the collection, and cannot modify an NFT after it leaves your wallet. Typos? Too late. New trait? Too bad.  
A collection created with it's own unique smart contract allows for more flexibility, and is overall better for the project long-term.

#### Archived Collections

Transaction histories are not carried over from previous contracts. However, it can still be referenced in the archives listed here:

> [DEVILISH NFTS [ARCHIVED]](https://opensea.io/collection/devilish-nfts-archived)  
> total vol before migrating: **58** Ξ  
> tokens burned so far: **20** / 38

> [CURSED OBJKTS [ARCHIVED]](https://opensea.io/collection/cursed-objkts-archived)  
> total vol before migrating: **2** Ξ  
> tokens burned so far: **28** / 78

_Holders were asked to trade in their old tokens so they could be burned. Some holders are harder to contact than others, so not all tokens have been burned. If you hold old tokens, please reach out to [@666sugoi](https://twitter.com/666sugoi)!_
